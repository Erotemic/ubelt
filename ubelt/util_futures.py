"""
Introduces the :class:`Executor` class that wraps the standard
ThreadPoolExecutor, ProcessPoolExecutor, and the new SerialExecutor with a
common interface and a configurable backend. This makes is easy to test if your
code benefits from parallism, how much it benefits, and gives you the ability
to disable if if you need to.


The :class:`Executor` class lets you choose the right level of concurrency
(which might be no concurrency). An excellent blog post on when to use
threads, processes, or asyncio [ChooseTheRightConcurrency]_.

Note that executor does not currently support asyncio, but this might be a
feature added in the future, but its unclear how interoperable this would be.
