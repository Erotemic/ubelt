This is util_time, it has a few functions for handling time related code that I
wish there was standard library support for.


The :func:`timestamp` is less interesting than the previous two methods, but I
have found it useful to have a function that quickly returns an iso8601
timestamp without much fuss.


Timerit is back! But it no longer lives in util_time. Instead it now lives in
ubelt/timerit.py
