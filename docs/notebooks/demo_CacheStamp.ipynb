    "The `ubelt.CacheStamp` class is used to mark that a block of code has been run, and it's output has been written to disk. \n",
    "\n",
    "You set up a `CacheStamp` by giving it a name and letting it know what files we expect to already exist or that need to be written. Then you, check if the stamp is \"expired\". If it is, you need to recompute the data you wish to cache and \"renew\" the stamp. If it is not expired, then you can expect that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The file already exist on disk.\n",
    "2. The file has not been tampered with since you wrote it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running renew records the size, modification time (mtime), and hash (checksum) of each file registered via product. Running expired checks checks that these attributes match with existing files on disk, which gives you the tamperproof guarantee. This mechanism is similar to how Makefiles and other build systems (e.g. CMake, redo) handle detecting when files are modified. (Note that it is possible to disable the hash checks by specifying `hasher=None` while still retaining size and mtime checks, this is useful when hashing files it too expensive)."
