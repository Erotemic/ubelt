    """
    When working with data, a common pattern is to iterate through it, and
    gather information about the work to be done, so a you can make a final
    structured pass through the data.

    In python we might do this by initializing an empty list and appending
    **dictionary of information**, to the list. (or you might yield
    dictionaries of information from a generator instead, either way you have a
    flat list).

    Some people might use lists of tuples instead of Lists of dictionaries, but
    using dictionaries makes it easy to add new information later (and it works
    very will with pandas).
